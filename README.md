# TCSiON-Rank-Features-of-a-Smartphone
Objective : The objective of this project is to build a python application that ranks the features of a smartphone based on the requests received from various users.

Python Application : I've used Spyder to create the web browser by gaining the help of streamlit. The code is available in the file named "webapp.py" and the trained model that I've used in the code is available in "trained_model.sav"

Video Walkthrough : So, I've entered the first entry from the MobileTrain dataset and the RANK is predicted as "3". You can see the final ranked dataset in the colab. The Rank is "3" if the price range is "1".

Outcome : Ranking is done based on predicted price range
