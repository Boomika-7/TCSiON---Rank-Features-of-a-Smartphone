# TCSiON-Rank-Features-of-a-Smartphone
Objective : The objective of this project is to build a python application that ranks the features of a smartphone based on the requests received from various users.
Python Application : I've used Spyder to create the web browser by gaining the help of streamlit. The code is available in the file named "webapp.py" and the trained model that I've used in the code is available in "trained_model.sav"
